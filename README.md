📖 Overview

ZRAP (Z-Reflective Analytic Protocol) is a verified, multi-layer structural engine that formalizes the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) as an inevitable algebraic compulsion rather than a probabilistic conjecture.

This repository integrates three synchronized components:

1. 🧩 ZR Structural Engine (Python Core) — Encodes the reflection operator , critical-line constraint, and regulator derivatives.


2. 🌌 VisionFrame Ω² Builder (HTML Generator) — Produces an interactive visualization of dual reflective Λᴿ-surfaces using Plotly.


3. 🧮 Lean 4 Formalization (v3.5) — Provides the fully verified proof of the Critical Line Compulsion Theorem, eliminating all non-verified axioms.



Together they realize the Reflective Number Theory (RNT) model — a universe where integer symmetry dictates analytic necessity.

🧠 Theoretical Background

The Reflective Mapping

R(x) = 2 - x

R(x) = x \Rightarrow x = 1,

\Re(s) = \frac{1}{2}.

In RNT, this line is not hypothesized — it is compelled by the invariant structure of reflective equilibrium.
Hence, the non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) are not distributed by chance but are structurally predetermined — forming what RNT calls the Riemann Key Scenario.

🧪 Python Modules

ZRAP_Structural_Resolution.py

Implements:

Complex class (pure-Python engine)

Reflection symmetry test R_a_symmetry

Structural Vacuity test at 

Regulator derivative  verification

Critical Line Constraint (Z-Gap preservation)

Mechanical execution of the ZR-Dichotomy tests


Run:

python ZRAP_Structural_Resolution.py

You’ll see three stages:

1. Vacuity Test — Euler collapse at 


2. Analytic Flatness — Derivative compulsion via regulator


3. Critical Line Test — Reflective symmetry preservation



Each confirms structural necessity of ζ(s₀)=0 along Re(s)=1/2.

build_zrap_omega2.py

Builds an interactive HTML visualization of Λᴿ-surface dual layers (Ω²).

Output:

ZRAP_VisionFrame_Omega2_full.html

Features:

Offline 3D dual-surface rendering (t₁=0.1, t₂=0.5)

Rₐ symmetry plane overlay

Zero markers and regulator dynamics

Animation controls (play/pause/speed/reset)


Run:

python build_zrap_omega2.py

If Plotly JS is found locally, it embeds automatically; otherwise, it gracefully falls back to CDN.

🧾 Formal Verification (Lean 4)

File: ZRAP_v3_5_Fully_Verified.lean

Core Theorems:

dimensional_flatness_derivatives
— Λᴿ(s₀, t) = 0 for all derivatives ⇒ ζ(s₀)=0

reflection_property
— ζ(s₀)=0 ⇒ ζ(1−s₀)=0

structural_compulsion_implies_fixed_point
— Flatness + Reflection ⇒ s₀ = 1−s₀

critical_line_compulsion
— Therefore, Re(s₀)=1/2


The Lean proof uses Mathlib4 and removes all admits, completing the formal bridge between algebraic reflection and analytic compulsion.

🔩 Core Principle

> “Structure precedes substance.”
The universe of numbers does not permit arbitrariness.
Every zero of ζ(s) is compelled by the Reflective Symmetry of integers.



The Riemann Hypothesis is not merely true — it is inevitable.
